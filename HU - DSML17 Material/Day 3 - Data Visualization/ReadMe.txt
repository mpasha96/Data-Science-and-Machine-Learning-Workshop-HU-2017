You can email me at hb.noorzai@gmail.com for any questions. Here are somethings I would like you to know:

1. Note that the quotes used in expressions are straight, plain quotes (text-only) not curly, smart quotes (rich text format). Not fixing this would throw an error if you tried to copy paste and run any code from the text files or the presentation.

2. All the libraries are availble on their homepages. Please refer to the APIs for a detail on all the available functions. It's a great way to learn. There are some amazing examples with all the libraries built atop of D3. Thanks to the JS console, you can inspect the code on any element and try adding the respective charts to your own dashboard. It's good practice to add the libraries .js file in your application rather than putting in the url in a script. 

3. The dashboard zip folder contains the stuff that shall go inside the app folder. Please make sure you place the dashboard.conf in the WAMP/Alias folder. All the libraries that we used, and the data is in this folder. This folder is complete, with all libraries, data and the style sheet.
